# Test Task Description

This test task involves creating a responsive landing page with the following requirements:

1. Responsive Design: The layout must adapt seamlessly from Full HD screens down to 375px width.
2. Optimization: Implement optimizations such as using WebP images, avoiding unnecessary image usage, and minifying compiled styles.
3. Source Files: Include all source files (SCSS, JS, etc.) in the final deliverable to demonstrate the approach and methodology.
4. News Block Slider: Convert the news block into a functional slider on mobile devices, ensuring the layout remains robust for varying content types like images and text.
5. Standalone Output: Provide a complete final output that can be opened directly via index.html without requiring build tools. Additionally, deploy the project to GitHub Pages or a similar hosting service for online viewing.
6. Optional Build Tools: While the use of tools like Gulp or Webpack is not mandatory, their usage would be a plus.
7. Parallax Effect: Implement a desktop-only parallax effect for hero images, where each image moves in different directions over small distances based on mouse movement.
8. Input Validation: Add optional input validation functionality for enhanced usability.
9. Fixed Header: Ensure the header remains fixed at the top of the page and visible during scrolling.
